This Project is not finished at all. I started it out of the blue and quite frankly 
never finsished due to being part of an IT course and having priorities there.

Started to work on it again. Moving between rooms works now and it's modular enough
so that adding new rooms isn't the most horrible thing to do on earth. Also made 
some small fixes in characterclasses and started the framework for the investigation function.
The language is still in german so maybe i should change that...

Working on investigating things in the room and updated gamebody and gamewindow for it to work. 
It's not working. Its still not working but i'm getting closer to fixing it.

Took a break because christmas. Investigating works now. I still have to implement closer 
investigation of objects and start to implement combat. That's probably it for today.

Fixed a bug in investigation and created the DruemmerCombat.py file. Combat is around 50ish%
done. Need to create spells/abilites and equipments. If all that is done then I think the demo
version should be finished.

Came to the conclusion that I first need to add Equipments to finish combat. Created Items and 
Equipments File. Started to work on a functioning inventory. A minimalistic version of 
equipping items exist now.
