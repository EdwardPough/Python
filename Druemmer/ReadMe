This Project is not finished at all. I started it out of the blue and quite frankly 
never finsished due to being part of an IT course and having priorities there.

22.12.2025
Started to work on it again. Moving between rooms works now and it's modular enough
so that adding new rooms isn't the most horrible thing to do on earth. Also made 
some small fixes in characterclasses and started the framework for the investigation function.
The language is still in german so maybe i should change that...

23.12.2025
Working on investigating things in the room and updated gamebody and gamewindow for it to work. 
It's not working. Its still not working but i'm getting closer to fixing it.

Took a break because christmas. Investigating works now. I still have to implement closer 
investigation of objects and start to implement combat. That's probably it for today.

05.01.2026
Fixed a bug in investigation and created the DruemmerCombat.py file. Combat is around 50ish%
done. Need to create spells/abilites and equipments. If all that is done then I think the demo
version should be finished.

07.01.2026
Came to the conclusion that I first need to add Equipments to finish combat. Created Items and 
Equipments File. Started to work on a functioning inventory. A minimalistic version of 
equipping items exist now.

08.01.2026
Equipping stuff actually works even though a bit buggy. Combat also got overhauled. Thats about
it I think.

09.01.2026
Update1
Combat is now like 85ish% done. Only abilities are missing. Equipping also works without any 
bugs and now you can call informations about your equipment. 
Update2
Its 90% now :-)

Had to restructure combat. Investigation is almost finished. After i'm done with investigation
i will work on abilities

14.01.2026
Investigation seems to be finished. Also did a little bugfixing and removing a handful of
redundant things.

16.01.2026
Am working on abilities and implementing them into combat. It is making some problems right now 
but nothing that can't be fixed. After that i will make some useable out of combat, change the
everything to english or german and then i'm probably done with the demo.

20.01.2026
I think i found a solution to the problems the abilities were making. I started implementing it.

21.01.2026
Got abilities working in combat now. Now i only have to implement the other abilities and make
some usable out of combat which shouldn't be end of the world.

22.01.2026
Finished all the current abilities. Though i am a bit unsure if want to make them usable out of 
combat. Only Consumables are left and then i should be finished with the demo.
